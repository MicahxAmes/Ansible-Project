# Ansible-Project

In this hands-on project, I demonstrated the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by combining Terraform and Ansible to automate the creation and configuration of AWS resources. The result was a streamlined infrastructure setup, including EC2 instances, VPCs, security groups, and a deployed static website.
