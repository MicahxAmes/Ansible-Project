# Ansible-Project

Project Guidelines:
Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Ansible:
Define your AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Create resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups
Use Ansible playbooks to configure your EC2 instances. Install necessary software, set up users, and manage SSH keys
Implement dynamic inventory in Ansible to automatically discover EC2 instances created by Terraform.
Deploy a sample application (e.g., a static website) on your EC2 instances.
